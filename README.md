# Splitwave

Splitwave is a node-based audio router for macOS, Linux, and Windows. Wire microphones, system audio, per-app capture, and WAV files into a visual graph, run them through a chain of effects — EQ, compression, reverb, limiting, and more, plus your own CLAP, VST3 and AU plugins — then send the result to speakers or record it in WAV, FLAC, AIFF, MP3, Opus, or AAC.

## Installation

### macOS

Download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/Horuse/Splitwave/releases/latest),
open it, and drag Splitwave to Applications.

**macOS will block the app on first launch** ("cannot verify developer") because the
binary is not notarized. To allow it, run once in Terminal:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Splitwave.app
```

Then open Splitwave normally.

**After each update, Screen Recording permission resets** (macOS revokes it when the binary changes and the app is unsigned). To re-grant it: open System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording, click **−** to remove Splitwave, then click **+** and add it back.

### Linux

Requires a PipeWire-based audio session (default on most current distros).
Device-volume control additionally needs the PulseAudio compatibility layer
(`pipewire-pulse`, also default on most distros).
Download the build for your system from [Releases](https://github.com/Horuse/Splitwave/releases/latest):

- **AppImage** — `chmod +x Splitwave_*.AppImage && ./Splitwave_*.AppImage`
- **`.deb`** (Debian/Ubuntu) — `sudo apt install ./Splitwave_*.deb`
- **`.rpm`** (Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE) — `sudo rpm -i Splitwave-*.rpm`

### Windows

Requires Windows 10 version 2004 or newer (for per-app capture) and the
[WebView2 runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
(preinstalled on current Windows 10/11). Download the `.exe` installer from
[Releases](https://github.com/Horuse/Splitwave/releases/latest) and run it.

To expose a Splitwave output as a microphone:

1. Open **Virtual devices** and choose **Install virtual microphone**.
2. Complete the VB-CABLE installer.
3. Restart Windows if Splitwave shows **Restart required**.
4. Select `CABLE Input` in a Speaker node.
5. Select `CABLE Output` as the microphone in the target app.

VB-CABLE is third-party donationware; see its
[official page](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) for licensing and support.

## Features

- **Inputs:** microphones, system audio, per-application audio, WAV files,
  virtual device loopback
- **Outputs:** physical speakers/interfaces, file recording in WAV (16/24-bit
  PCM + 32-float), FLAC, AIFF, Opus, MP3, AAC (M4A), virtual devices
- **Effects:** Gain, Mute, Channel Balance, Saturator, 10-band Graphic EQ,
  Brick-wall Limiter with look-ahead, Compressor (with sidechain), Noise Gate
  (with sidechain), Noise Suppressor, De-esser, Declick, Stereo Delay,
  Algorithmic Reverb (Freeverb), Level Meter, EBU R128 LUFS Meter, Waveform and
  Spectrum analyzers
- **Plugins:** host your own CLAP and VST3 plugins (all platforms) and Audio
  Unit plugins (macOS) as effect nodes, with the native editor embedded in the
  app, parameters editable in the node, and plugin state saved with the
  pipeline. On Linux, plugin editors need an X11 session (XWayland works);
  VST3 defines no Wayland embedding
- **Presets & templates:** shared effect presets with factory defaults, plus
  ready-made pipeline templates in the create flow
- **Virtual devices:** create named virtual audio devices that appear system-wide
  on macOS and Linux. Windows uses the single fixed VB-Audio VB-CABLE pair as a
  managed virtual microphone; it does not provide arbitrary named Windows devices.

System and per-app capture use **ScreenCaptureKit** on macOS, **PipeWire** on
Linux, and **WASAPI loopback** / the **Process Loopback API** on Windows. Virtual
devices are AudioServerPlugin drivers on macOS and PipeWire null-sinks on Linux.
Windows uses VB-Audio VB-CABLE through the existing WASAPI output path.

## Stack

- **Frontend:** Svelte, Tauri, @xyflow/svelte
- **Engine:** Rust -- `rtrb` (SPSC ring buffers), `rubato` (resampling),
  `hound` (WAV), `flac-codec`, `opus`, `mp3lame-encoder`, `ebur128`
- **macOS:** `cpal` device I/O; custom Swift static library for ScreenCaptureKit,
  compiled by `build.rs` via `swiftc`; CoreAudio HAL FFI for device enumeration;
  libASPL-based AudioServerPlugin for the virtual device driver
- **Linux:** `pipewire` for device I/O, system/app capture, and virtual
  null-sinks; `libpulse-binding` for device-volume control (talks to
  `pipewire-pulse`); `freedesktop-desktop-entry` / `freedesktop-icons` for app
  icons
- **Windows:** `cpal` (WASAPI) device I/O; the `windows` crate for WASAPI
  loopback + Process Loopback capture, `IAudioEndpointVolume`, audio-session
  enumeration, and exe icon extraction (`png` for encoding)
